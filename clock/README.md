# Future Time - Reimagined Clock

I decided this time to take a bit of a simple approach, using the model of a clock but trying to spin it on it's head in a way. The code itself wasn't very difficult to figure out in and of itself, the most challenging being learning about half-pi from p5.js, which halves a circumfrence. The other challenging part was figuring out a good size for the ellipses themselves, and making them get smaller and smaller inside one another. Other than that, it was a fun project to work on. I took note of TheCodingTrain and how arcs can be properly implemented as well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4RyStef-gY).

The clock is read from outside to inside, the outside color, red, indicating the hour, blue indicating the minute, and green indicating the second.

By far the greatest challenge was finding the right idea, as my mind kept going back and forth between several ideas. This, the seperated circles, was my original idea, but I kept trying to think of something a bit more unique. I eventually thought of using the greek alphabet in place of the hours, being 24 letters and 24 hours in a day. Unfortunately, this came off as way too difficult to make an actual reality, or at least I had little idea how to make it work well. I eventually went back to my original idea and stuck with it, and it turned out to be pretty great, I'd say.

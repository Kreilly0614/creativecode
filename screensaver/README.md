# Falling Stars | Particle Screensaver

This project allowed to create what I think is one of my best works so far in the class this year, and probably went through the most changes from beginning to end. To start, mine involves the downward motion of several random particles made to look like rain, adding a black background and filling the particles with a cyan color to add a bit more uniqueness. When I first brainstormed, I originally was planning on creating a series of bubbles that constantly floated to the top of the screen, but shifted that to the idea of rain when I began messing around with editor.p5.js a bit more.

The code itself wasn't all too difficult for the most part, and actually made a lot of sense once I realized how it all worked together to make the function operate. The more difficult part seemed to be creating something that seemed truly original, and I'm happy with the end result of this project.

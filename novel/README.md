# Dog Story

This code randomly repeats sounds that would be classified as dog sounds, like "ruff" and "woof", along with a few others to add a bit of mix to the "novel". While not my first choice, this ultimately was my favorite and best by far novel generated. Taking lots of insight from what you had shown us in class and shared within Discord, this was a Google collab that imported weasyprint and used randomness variables to turn the sounds into sentences, paragraphs and even chapters. It was a bit tough at some points as collab constantly gave error codes for some bits I thought should've worked just fun, but all in all this was a success.
